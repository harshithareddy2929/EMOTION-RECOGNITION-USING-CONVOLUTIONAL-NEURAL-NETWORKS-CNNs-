# EMOTION-RECOGNITION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS-CNNs-
This project explores the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion recognition tasks. Using the PyTorch framework, the project involves building a model capable of detecting human emotions from facial expressions in images.
